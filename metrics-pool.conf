; =============================================================================
; METRICS POOL — Dedicated PHP-FPM Pool for Dashboard Metrics
; =============================================================================
;
; PURPOSE:
;   This pool reserves 2 dedicated workers exclusively for metrics endpoints.
;   These workers cannot be starved by load test traffic on the main pool.
;
; ROUTES (configured in nginx):
;   /api/metrics/*    → port 9001 (this pool)
;   /api/health/*     → port 9001 (this pool)
;   Everything else   → port 9000 (main www pool)
;
; POOL SIZE:
;   - pm = static with 2 workers (always available)
;   - These workers are lightweight (metrics are fast reads)
;   - 2 workers can handle 8 requests/second at 250ms polling interval
;
